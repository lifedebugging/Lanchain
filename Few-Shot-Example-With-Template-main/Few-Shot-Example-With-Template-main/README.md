# Few-Shot-Example-With-Template

**summary**

In the ``code.py`` I am using a **Langchain** template and teaching the model with few shot examples.

So, the question is what it does?

Well, It's a emoji translator, what it does is you type the expression/thing in a **text** format and it will show you the emoji relevant to that expression/thing you mentioned.

Example:

input : `fire`

output : emoji for fire -> 🔥

How it works?
