Today we're talking about Agents. Yeah,  agents in `Langchain` not MIB agents.

# Agents
Before I explain anything look at the picture down below:

*Reference : Microsoft/langchain-for-beginners*

An **Standard LLM** is good for expremient, local chat and simple factual question (depending on how frequent upto date it's knowledge base is).
Where An Agent has many advantages over **standard LLM**.

Before we talk about an  LLM `agent` advantages. We need to answer what is agent anyway?

An Agent is LLM in steroids. An agent is an LLM impowered with tools.

To understand what that means, here's the anology:

> Tony Stark (Standard LLM): He is genius, he knows everything, he can solve math problems, write poetry about his assitant and answer almost any question. But he can't fly because he's just a man.
> Iron Man (Agent with tools): Tony Stark + The suit(tools) now he can fly. fire missiles and talk to Jarvis from anywhere like making an external  connection using his suit(tools).

In short, what makes an Agent better from Standard LLM is it's *ability to use tools* which allow it to access real-time data and take actions, while standard LLMs are limited to their training data.

 Standard LLM: Input -> Process -> Output. (One shot).
 Agent (With Tools): Input -> Think -> Act -> Output.
