What are we talking about today is Template composition, basically like a cluster of template.

Take a look at `code.py` and the first Template is actually a common for every template used in the code. 

It's a universal behavior also you can add more detail by calling **"system"** with in a template. I myself didn't knew we could that.

I actually compare it to the Memory calling method where we feed/ append the answer back to **AI** to continue the conversation here we're achieving same kind of result but with **template**.

That's it, see you next time.
